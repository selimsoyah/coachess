## 🎮 Using the Chess Board

### For Lessons (PGN)

The chess board shows the full game with navigation controls:

- **⏮ First**: Jump to starting position
- **◀ Previous**: Go back one move
- **▶ Next**: Advance one move
- **⏭ Last**: Jump to final position

**Tips:**
- Watch the game move by move to understand the strategy
- Go back to review critical moments
- Study the opening, middle game, and endgame separately

### For Puzzles (FEN)

The chess board shows a specific position:

- Study the position carefully
- Think about the best move
- Consider your coach's instructions
- Look for tactics: forks, pins, skewers, checkmates

## 💡 Pro Tips

**Managing Students:**
- Keep track of which content you've assigned (use notes)
- Create a progression path for your students
- Mix lessons with puzzles for variety
- Regular check-ins help student progress

**Content Organization:**
- Use consistent naming (e.g., "Lesson 1: ", "Puzzle 1: ")

### For Players

**Studying Effectively:**
- Take your time with each lesson
- Try to predict the next move before revealing it
- Review lessons multiple times
- Ask your coach questions about confusing positions

**Solving Puzzles:**
- Don't rush to the answer

## 🔍 Understanding Chess Notation

### PGN (Portable Game Notation)

PGN records entire games:

```
1. e4 e5    (Move 1: White plays e4, Black plays e5)
2. Nf3 Nc6  (Move 2: White plays knight to f3, Black plays knight to c6)
3. Bc4 Bc5  (Move 3: White plays bishop to c4, Black plays bishop to c5)
```

**Common Symbols:**
- `K` = King
- `Q` = Queen
- `R` = Rook
- `B` = Bishop
- `N` = Knight
- (Pawns have no letter)
- `x` = Capture
- `+` = Check
- `#` = Checkmate
- `O-O` = Kingside castle
- `O-O-O` = Queenside castle

### FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation)

FEN describes a single position:

```
rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1
```

- Lowercase = Black pieces
- Uppercase = White pieces
- Numbers = Empty squares
- `/` = Next rank (row)

You don't need to understand FEN in detail - just copy/paste it!
